DESCRIPTION
-----------
Git-patch provides a set of commands to manipulate commits as if they were a
stack of patches, similar to stacked-git. The key difference is that git-patch
is intended to interoperate with *git(1)*.

COMMANDS
--------

*series* ::
    List commits on the current branch as well as those that
    have been popped.

*pop* ::
    Removes a commit from the current branch. The commit is saved
    under refs/git-patch/<branch>/<name> for later retrieval.

*push* ::
    Re-apply a previously popped patch.

*float* ::
    Raise a commit up to the top of the current branch.
